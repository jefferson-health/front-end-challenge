# Challenge
In any JavaScript framework of your choosing (we like to use React) complete the below tasks. You won't be judged on the UI style but just make sure that it is usable. Once finished, please push to your personal Github. Make sure you provide any special steps that are needed to run the app locally in your README file.

## Tasks
1) Include the provided `users.json` in to your app and display a list of users under a "User List" section. For each user display the following fields:

    * Image
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Email

2) Now add a button to each user in the list that when clicked selects the user, removes it from the "User List" and shows it under a "Selected User" section.

3) Include a new button that allows the current selected user to be removed and added back into the "User List" section.

4) Lastly, add a dropdown to the UI that allows for the list of users to be sorted by the selected value in ascending order. The dropdown should include the below values:

    * First Name
    * Last Name
